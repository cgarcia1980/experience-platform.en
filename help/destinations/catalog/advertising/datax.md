*Add information in this section about anything that customers need to be aware of before starting to set up the destination in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface. This can be about:*

* *needing to be added to an allow list*
* *requirements for email hashing*
* *any account specifics on your side*
* *how to obtain an API key to connect to your platform*

*You can link out to your relevant documentation if that would be useful to customers.*

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}


*Add information in this section about the identities supported by your destination. We have prefilled the table with some standard values. Delete the values that don't apply to your destination and add values that are not prefilled.*

*YOURDESTINATION* supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/namespaces.html?lang=en#getting-started).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|email_lc_sha256|Email addresses hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|

## Export type {#export-type}

**Segment Export** - you are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (name, phone number, or others) used in the *YOURDESTINATION* destination.

## Use Cases {#use-cases}
(Add 1-2 use cases for advertisers to use this new destination - VMG)

To help you better understand how and when you should use the *YOURDESTINATION* destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.


### Use Case #1

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*

### Use Case #2

*For social network platforms:*

*An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to YOURDESTINATION, to display ads in their customers' social media feeds.*
