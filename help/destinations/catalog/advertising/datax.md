### Use Case #1

DataX APIs are available for advertisers that want to target a specific audience group keyed of email addresses in Verizon Media (VMG) can quickly create a new segment and push the desired audience group using VMG's near-real-time API.

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*
